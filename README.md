# Dimensionality-Reduction-with-Autoencoder

- Designed, trained and evaluated an autoencoder using 50-dimensional data and extracted its encoder for dimensionality reduction
- Created a dataset of 50 dimensions and preprocessed the data 
- Created a PCA model as a baseline for model peroformance
- Trained the PCA model using scikit-learn
- Reduced its dimensionality of the 50-dimensional dataset using the encoder half of an autoencoder within scikit-learn
